        In week 8, we were experimented more with Arduino and worked with audio 
        and creating audio using touch sensor. We broke down the components of 
        the Arduino set. We experimented with using potatoes as a sound source 
        for the sensor. In the workshop, I noticed that the work the experiment 
        I worked on produced sounds like Do, Re, Mi. 
        
        I found this particularly fascinating because I did not intent on it to 
        produce that sounds. I thought that it was fun that I was able to somwhat play 
        "Old McDonald". Even though I find Arduino work to be extremely difficult to 
        do, I think that the outcome is very unique since its very personalized to 
        how you want it to look like. 
        
        Working with the sensors reminds me of a project I did back in high school 
        where I made a heartbeat detector but learning it and at the same time thinking
        of it in a more design aspect is definitely something that is new to me. Overall, 
        this week's studio class is very insightful and its where I fixed my thoughts on whether 
        I want to stick with coding or taking a step further and work with Arduino.
